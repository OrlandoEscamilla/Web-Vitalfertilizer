      <p class="contmaster-interiors__div__p">Vital Hi-N速 24-9-5 is an NPK  specialty fertilizer formula designed to increase plant biomass and enhance root development. It is a nitrate-based formulation, providing an important balance between various forms of nitrogen to obtain a phytotonic effect and quick response in the plant. This formulation is powered by RBTTM Root Bioenhancer Technology, which is the combination of organic acids in precise balance with inorganic nutrients that boost root biomass development and increase nutrient uptake by an improved interaction between soil and root system. It also includes key micronutrients to promote vigorous growth. The interaction between its nitrogen components gives a special potency to early stages of the crop. It is recommended for those species or varieties that require high levels of nitrogen but also significant levels of phosphate as an energy source. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Vital Hi-N速 24-9-5 is recommended for row crops, vegetables, and orchards, where a prompt effect and rapid response from the crop is expected. Its nitrate content has a phytotonic effect, generating a darker green color and enhancing vigorous growth, specifically in short-term crops like leafy greens.</p>
