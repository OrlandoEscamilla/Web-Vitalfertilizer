      <p class="contmaster-interiors__div__p"><span class="bold">Vital Plant Nutrition ProgramTM</span>is a complete plant nutrition system developed for row crops and some specialty crops, for farmers who are constantly seeking more yields and better quality of harvest through proven water-soluble nutrient technology. Our proposal is based on multi-nutrient and well-balanced formulations added with organic components to enhance crop performance. Our program consists of a pop-up starter fertilizer and three Hi-specialty fertilizers, that can be applied either straight or combined, designed to fit specific needs of any crop and any farmer.</p>
        <br>
        <p>All products are powered by RBTTM Root Bioenhancer Technology, to promote root system development and nutrient absorption by the plant. All formulae are balanced with macro and micronutrients. By following this complete program, you can increase yields and improve quality at harvest through a base fertilization before planting, an effective emergence at planting, and a consistent vegetative development in post-emergence.</p>
        <br>

        <br>
        <p><span class="bold">Vital Start®</span>is an organo-mineral <span class="bold"> NPK formulation</span> that is obtained by the combination of organic compounds with inorganic fertilizers. Vital Start® has been added with <span class="bold"> RBTTM Root Bioenhancer Technology</span> – which is the combination of organic acids in precise balance with inorganic nutrients that boost root biomass development and increase nutrient uptake by an improved interaction between soil and root system.</p>
        <br>
        <p>These organic acids act as a kind of  “nutrient-mining” agent by allowing a better absorption of nutrients already present in the soil as well as those contained in the Vital Start® formulation</p>
